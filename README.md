# Pimlico ERC20 Paymaster
## Overview
PimlicoERC20Paymaster is an ERC-4337 Paymaster contract by Pimlico which is able to sponsor gas fees in exchange for ERC20 tokens. The contract refunds excess tokens if the actual gas cost is lower than the initially provided amount. It also allows updating price configuration and withdrawing tokens by the contract owner. The contract uses an Oracle to fetch the latest token prices.

## Features
- ERC20 token payments for transaction fees
- Refunding excess tokens based on actual gas cost
- Updating price configuration
- Withdrawing tokens by contract owner
- Fetching latest token prices using an Oracle

## Contract
The PimlicoERC20Paymaster contract inherits from BasePaymaster.

## Development setup

This repository uses both hardhat and foundry for development, and assumes you have already installed hardhat/foundry

### hardhat

Hardhat is used for gas metering and developing sdk.

1. install dependencies
```shell
npm install
```
2. run test
```
Npx hardhat test
```
This will show results for the gas metering on different modes based on 1) refund 2) token payment limit 3) price update

*note* : first transaction is expensive because nonce increases 0 -> 1

### foundry

Foundry is used for unit tests

1. install dependencies
```shell
forge install
```

2. run tests
```shell
forge test
```

3. run coverage
```shell
forge coverage
```
